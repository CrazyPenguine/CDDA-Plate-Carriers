# CDDA-Plate-Carriers

A mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead that adds plate carriers based on lightweight plate carriers such as the Crye Precision JPC or the Spiritus Systems LV-119. They have similar protection to the existing ESAPI ballistic vest minus the protection granted by the empty ballistic vest, cover less of the torso, provide less warmth, are less encumbering, and include three magazine pouches.

The plate carriers come in four variants:
* Empty
* Filled with two ESAPI plates
* Filled with two steel plates
* A mutant-friendly XL version filled with one ESAPI plate and three ESBI plates

Plate carriers have been added to several item groups and monster drops so you should be able to find them on military, police, and survivor corpses, at a lower rate than ESAPI ballistic vests. This is subject to rebalancing (plate carriers should be more common than military full ballistic vests on normal police, for example). Plate carriers can also be found in military surplus stores.

The steel-filled version is not found on the military, is less common than the ESAPI version on police, and is more common than the ESAPI version on survivors and in military surplus stores (where the empty version is the most common).

Players can craft plate carriers once they have Tailoring 4 and Marksman 1.

# Issues

* The mod was made for version 0.F and may not be compatible with the experimental version
* The author does not fully grasp item groups, so, who knows what shenanigans will happen when used with other mods
* All weights are based on real-life weights and NOT on the components used to make the filled versions. As such, the empty plate carriers + 2 already-in-game ESAPI plates may not = the ESAPI-filled plate carrier; I haven't checked how much the in-game ESAPI plates weigh, only the IRL plates. The steel plate loaded plate carrier is based on Spartan Armor System's level III 10"x12" shooter plates, more or less, which weight noticably more than the already-existing in-game steel_armor item used in the recipe
* Loading magazines into the pouches probably should encumber the player much less than they do, though I'm not sure how to change this
