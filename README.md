# CDDA-Plate-Carriers

A mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead that adds plate carriers based on lightweight plate carriers such as the Crye Precision JPC or the Spiritus Systems LV-119. They have similar protection to the existing ESAPI ballistic vest minus the protection granted by the empty ballistic vest, cover less of the torso, provide less warmth, are less encumbering, and include three magazine pouches.

The plate carriers come in four variants:
* Empty
* Filled with two ESAPI plates
* Filled with two steel plates
* A mutant-friendly XL version filled with one ESAPI plate and three ESBI plates

Plate carriers have been added to several item groups and monster drops so you should be able to find them on military, police, and survivor corpses, at a lower rate than ESAPI ballistic vests. This is subject to rebalancing. Plate carriers can also be found in military surplus stores.

The steel-filled version is not found on the military, is less common than the ESAPI version on police, and is more common than the ESAPI version on survivors and in military surplus stores (where the empty version is the most common).

Players can craft plate carriers once they have Tailoring 4 and Marksman 1.
